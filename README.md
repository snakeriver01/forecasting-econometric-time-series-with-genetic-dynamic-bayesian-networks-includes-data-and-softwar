# forecasting-econometric-time-series-with-genetic-dynamic-bayesian-networks-includes-data-and-softwar
The software includes a dynamic bayesian network with genetic feature space selection, includes 5 macro-economic data.frames with 
244 to 263 time series going back to 01-01-1991. The data.frames are: gdpDb; cpiDb, payemsDb (payroll employment), unrateDb (unemployment rate). I also included stockDb, which contains most of the SP500. These are all tab delimited text files with clear concise column names and dates serving as row.names for the time series.
