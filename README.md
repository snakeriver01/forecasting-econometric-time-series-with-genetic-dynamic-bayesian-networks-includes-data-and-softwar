The software includes a dynamic bayesian network with genetic feature space selection, includes 5 econometric data.frames with 
244 to 263 time series going back to 01-01-1991. The data.frames are: gdpDb; cpiDb, payemsDb (payroll employment), unrateDb (unemployment rate). I also included stockDb, which contains most of the SP500.
